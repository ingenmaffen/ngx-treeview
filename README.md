## Notes

This package is forked from [leovo2708's ngx-treeview](https://github.com/leovo2708/ngx-treeview) repo only to fix compatibility with Angular 9. For more info about the package visit the original repository.

Version 10.0.3 Fixes the issue that dropdownDirective is missing from TreeViewComponent.

Update: I had to remove 10.0.3 because it did not work (gave errors on init), but 9.1.1 still works on Angular 9 and 10.
